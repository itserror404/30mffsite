# ASSIGNMENT #1: 30MFF WEB SITE

The website house the 30MFF film made my our group. The film is based on the idea of Distraction and Boredom. It captures such emotions of students during online classes. I wanted to create an interactive website having elements such as the Parallax effect and Image Caroussel. 
I started with the header and I wanted it to be a responsive header, i.e. a header that would adapt based on screen/window size.
