# ASSIGNMENT #1: 30MFF WEB SITE
**Project Name:** 
Distraction: Emotions during Virtual times

**Project Description:**
The website house the 30MFF film made my our group. The film is based on the idea of Distraction and Boredom. It captures such emotions of students during online classes. I wanted to create an interactive website having elements such as the Parallax effect and Image Caroussel. However, the Image Caroussel was preety tricky for me and I instead implemented a top scrolling button.

**Process:**
I started with the header and created a basic header containing elements:
- Home
- Film
- Cast 
- BTS  // behind the scenes

So, for this I used the header tag and added the hyperlinks. 
Next, I worked on the Header image that spans across the website but with a certain height, and looks like a header image. I played around with the CSS positioning and gave a parallax effect. I designed a simple image pointing towards our theme of distraction.
For the background, I choose a white-greyish color image with confetti like dots to give it a distracted from studies effect. The header image also points towards the same theme.
Then I embedded the Film (which I uploaded on YouTube because of size issues).
I then listed out the team members under Cast.
The last section was the BTS, i.e. behind the scenes. I designed some BTS pictures on Canva and used hover-change effect. So, the image changes upon hovering the cursor over it. 
Now, the footer. Similar to the header, this part was done easily through the footer tag.
In each step, I added an id to them, so that the page could be navigated easily using hyperlinks at the header.
For the interative element, I choose a scroll to top button. I watched this tutorial for the effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJVCvnKM_lI 

**Reflection/Evaluation:**
I would say 90% of the expectations were met especially for the fact that I am pretty new to Web Development. The example websites shown in previous classes made me have high expectations with my website as well, however it was feasible to add all my favourite elements all at once. I also initially planned to have several webpages i.e. a webpage for each section but as I decided to implement the scroll button, that didn't occur. 

It was a fun experience, learnt a lot not just by making the website but also by browsing for inspiration websites, templates, tutorials, etc!
